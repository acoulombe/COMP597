### A5 Pick and Place

The controller used is the inverse kinematics controller.
To run the pick and place task, the instructions to run are the same as in the assignment guidelines.
The pick and place work and is able to bring the ball to the target position, however there are cases where the tuning of the joint position controller of the robot cause the ball to "collide" out of the grasp of the fingers.
